# Current limitations

It's not black magic, we have to pay something:

- __InCluster network__: at the moment there is no support for in-cluster communication b/w remote container and k8s cluster network. Meaning that service that are NOT exposed to the external network cannot be accessed from the pod running on the virtual kubelet. There are plans to include the support for this, we are not simply there yet.
- __Cluster wide shared FS__: there is no support for cluster-wide filesystem mounting on the remote container. The only volumes supported are: `Secret`, `ConfigMap`, `EmptyDir`
- __enroot environment__: with `ContainerRuntime: enroot` the plugin passes the pod's env, the gang's `slurm-job.vk.io/mpi-env` and the rank variables `RANK`, `WORLD_SIZE`, `MASTER_ADDR`, `MASTER_PORT` and `RAY_ADDRESS` through its own enroot `--conf` script. enroot's environment holds one variable per line, so a pod variable whose value contains a newline (a PEM key, multi-line JSON) or whose name is not a shell identifier (`a.b`) is skipped, with only a warning in the plugin's log, and such an `mpi-env` entry is dropped without one: mount such values as files instead. The pod's own value wins over a gang variable of the same name. The plugin does not pass Slurm and PMI variables (`SLURM_*`, `PMIX_*`, ...): they reach the container only if the site's enroot hooks pass them. enroot runs a single `--conf`, so `-c` or `--conf` in `EnrootDefaultOptions` or in the `slurm-job.vk.io/enroot-options` annotation makes the pod fail at creation.

That's all. If you find anything else, feel free to let it know filing a github issue.
